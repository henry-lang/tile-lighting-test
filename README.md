# Tile Lighting Test

Simple tile based lighting algorithm with color blending, pretty fast in this implementation (~2/5 ms) - could use for realtime games like Terraria. Handles a lot of lights without too much additional time.

Smooth lighting is also implemented by rendering a texture with interpolation on top of the tiles.
